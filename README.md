# Arduino-smart-car
🚗💡 Introducing My Arduino-Powered Smart Car Project! 💡🚗 

Excited to share my latest project: an Arduino Car that combines automation, control, and creativity into a single build! Here's what makes this project stand out: 

### Components Used: 
- Arduino UNO: The brain behind the car. 
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor & Servo Motor: For obstacle detection and navigation. 
- HC05 Bluetooth Module: Enables wireless control via the mobile app 'RoboBoy.' 
- DHT Sensor: Monitors and displays temperature & humidity. 
- L298 Motor Driver: Powers the car's movement. 
- LED Lights: Functional front and rear lights. 
- LCD Display with I2C: Acts as the number plate and displays sensor data. 
- Buzzer Alarm: For the horn. 
- 12V Battery, Jumper Wires, Chassis, and Wheels: To bring it all together! 

### Features & Functionalities: 
1️⃣ Manual Control: Uses the 'RoboBoy' mobile app to drive the car forward, backward, left, and right via Bluetooth. 
2️⃣ Functional Lights: 
 - Front lights (white LEDs) for visibility. 
 - Backlights/indicators (red LEDs) for breaks and turns. 
 - A buzzer horn for added functionality. 
3️⃣ Interactive Display: An LCD at the back displays the car's "number plate," alongside real-time temperature and humidity readings. 
4️⃣ Speed Control: Adjust the car's speed using the mobile app for a customized driving experience. 
5️⃣ Automatic Mode with Obstacle Avoidance: 
 - The car navigates autonomously by detecting obstacles in its path using the Ultrasonic sensor. 
 - It stops, analyzes the best route (left or right), and adjusts its direction automatically to continue its journey. 
 - This process repeats until manual control is resumed. 

This project was a fantastic learning experience in combining multiple components to achieve a cohesive, functional design.
